# NASA-Turbofan
Hi guys, 
I created this classification model in python for classifying various turbofan engines based on their time to failure for their predictive maintenance. This model can predict the current condition of the turbofan by using the data provided by the engine IVC.

Below is the relationships shown in the analysis.
